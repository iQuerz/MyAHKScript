# My AHK Script
This is an [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script that I use on a daily basis for my PC. It features a few shortcuts that help me stay productive. They are mostly already existing shortcuts remapped to my liking, all around the use of the "alt" key. I set it up as such because I think the alt key is the best modifier for left hand shortcuts, which is 100% of the time on your keyboard, while the right hand is changing between the mouse and the keyboard. I will list the shortcuts below.

#### Alt + Q:
*Closes the Active Window and brings to focus last one used.*

#### Alt + W:
*Minimizes the Active Window and brings to focus last one used.*

#### Alt + E:
*Opens File Explorer.*

#### Alt + A:
*Opens Windows notifications.*

#### Alt + S
*Runs Windows ScreenSnip for making a quick screenshot.*

#### Alt + Scroll
*Horizontal scroll. Scrolling up means left and down means right.*

That's not technically everything. I have another repository dedicated to running powershell by f12 key with additional fancy stuff. you can check it out [here](https://github.com/iQuerz/PowerShellAHK). If you have any suggestions, please contact me, I like adding useful shortcuts to my workflow.
