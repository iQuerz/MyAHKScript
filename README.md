# My AHK Script
This is an [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script that I use on a daily basis for my PC. It features a few shortcuts that help me stay productive. They are mostly already existing shortcuts remapped to my liking, all around the use of the "alt" key. I set it up as such because I think the alt key is the best modifier for left hand shortcuts, which is 100% of the time on your keyboard, while the right hand is changing between the mouse and the keyboard. I will list the shortcuts below.

#### Alt + Q:
*Closes the Active Window and brings to focus last one used.*

#### Alt + W:
*Minimizes the Active Window and brings to focus last one used.*

#### Alt + 8, 9 or 0:
*Stands for Delete, Home and End functionalities respectively*

#### Alt + E:
*Opens File Explorer.*

#### Alt + A:
*Opens Windows notifications.*

#### Alt + S
*Runs Windows ScreenSnip for making a quick screenshot.*

#### Windows Key
*Runs a [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys#microsoft-powertoys) feature called "Run". I use this in conjunction with [TaskBarX](https://chrisandriessen.nl/taskbarx), to create a clean environment.*

#### Alt + Scroll
*Horizontal scroll. Scrolling up means left and down means right.*

#### Semicolon + `I`,`J`,`K` & `L` Keys
*Simulates arrow keys while holding down the semicolon. Useful when your hands are on the homerow position.*

If you like my work, I have another repository dedicated to running powershell by f12 key with additional fancy stuff. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/iQuerz/PowerShellAHK#powershellahk). If you have any thoughts or suggestions, your words are more than welcome.
